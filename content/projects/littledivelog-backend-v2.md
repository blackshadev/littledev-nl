title: Littledivelog (server) v2
description: >-
    The backend for the divelog webapp which I use to log my own dives. I also have a client to
    download dives from my dive computer to the webapp. Version 2 is written in PHP because I wanted to have a toy project with PHP Laravel
    and the nodeJS backend was rather hacked together without much tests or maintainability.
