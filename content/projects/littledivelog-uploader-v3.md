title: Littledivelog (Uploader) v3
description: >-
    A client to upload dives read from a dive computer to my littledivelog server.
    This is a rewrite of my dive uploader in Javascript with electron to allow for cross platform compatibility. 
    It uses React with styled-components for the front-end with redux for state management and redux-saga to handle side-effects. I ended up liking React more than I expected, while liking redux, less than I expected. Redux certainly is nice tech, but something I had a hard time with, is the fact that there API enabled you to quickly create a mess. The API doesn't encourage good practices, there documentation doesn't state good practices and there 'toolbox' leaves gaps in there functionality (which redux saga does solve) which again encouraging bad practices.
