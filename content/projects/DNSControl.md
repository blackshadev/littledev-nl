title: DNSControl
description: >-
    DNSControl is a way to manage your DNS entries centralized in code. Even if they span multiple providers.
    I made the provider to let DNSControl work with TransIP. On top of that created some fixes for open issues in DNSControl.
    And I contributed to the way DNSControl managed dependencies between records and orders them accordingly.
    DNSControl is a project maintained and created by the folks from StackExchange, I merely submitted some code.
