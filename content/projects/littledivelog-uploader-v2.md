title: Littledivelog (Uploader) v2
description: >- 
    A client to upload dives read from a dive computer to my littledivelog server.
    This is a rewrite of my dive uploader in C++ QT to allow for cross platform compatibility.
    I ended up rewriting this again. because I didn't like how QT handled installers cross compatibility, or the lack thereof. Moreover, allot of the features you'd want are put behind a pay-wall, something I am not a fan off. Moreover compiling to a foreign system, which you don't own, is a pain.
